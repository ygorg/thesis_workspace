We study how to allocate the maximal allowable transmission delay at each node, such that the amount of information collected at the sink is maximized and the total delay for the data aggregation is within the given bound. We formulate the problem by using dynamic programming and propose an optimal algorithm for the optimal assignment of transmission attempts. Based on the analysis of the optimal solution, we propose a distributed greedy algorithm. It is shown to have a similar performance as the optimal one. algorithms design performance sensor networks data aggregation real-time traffic csma/ca delay constrained transmission'"

       "{'abstract': 'In this work, the immersed element-free Galerkin method (IEFGM) is proposed for the solution of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. In this technique, the FSI is represented as a volumetric force in the momentum equations. In IEFGM, a Lagrangian solid domain moves on top of ail Eulerian fluid domain that spans over the entire computational region. The fluid domain is modeled using the finite element method and the solid domain is modeled using file element-free Galerkin method. The continuity between the solid and fluid domains is satisfied by means of a local approximation, in the vicinity of the solid domain, of the velocity field and the FSI force. Such ail approximation is achieved using the moving least-squares technique. The method was applied to simulate the motion of a deformable disk moving in a viscous fluid due to the action of the gravitational force and the thermal convection of the fluid. Ail analysis of the main factors affecting the shape and trajectory of the solid body is presented. The method shows a distinct advantage for simulating FSI problems with highly deformable solids.
